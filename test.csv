I am absolutely in love with this camera! It has a chic old-school design with great processing power. I bought this for a month long trip through Europe and it served me well. The pictures are high quality and clear, while the camera is lightweight and durable. The Olympus app made downloading my pictures incredibly easy and straightforward, all you need is Wifi. The battery lasted a whole day of exploring with a relatively quick recharging time. I am so impressed with this camera and it's pictures, it's become my go-to and prefer it over my iPhone. This camera is a must-have in beginner-intermediate's camera collection as it's size, aesthetic, and quality are top-notch for an entry level camera.

1,1,Kindle Customer,5.0,I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!,"
I'll try to keep it short and sweet. Nikon user for over 10yrs. Photo passes for concerts, comedy, and live shows. This camera is the best street photography camera I've ever owned. I shoot jpeg on the street. But what about raw!. It's an old school feel with modern tech. Raw is great. But that's not the point. It's a walk around action camera with great color saturation and white balance.Pro: light weight, shoot all day, feels great, battery life awesome on jpeg, sharp pics, for the art camera, great in low lightCon: it's not a video camera: go Lumix G9, a lot options for a beginner; but a YouTube vid can fix that.I really like this camera and it's become my favorite camera. Plus the lens are sooo cheap!

2,2,Alex The Animal,4.0,Very good camera,"
I am not a professional. I wanted a camera that was better than the garbage that comes on a cell phone, but didn't want something as bulking as most DSLR camera. I wanted to be able to take it with me most places I went. This is what I arrived at. Very good camera, take incredible quality pictures! They don't look super great on the screen, but once I brought them over to my laptop they looked INCREDIBLE!Only 2 things I was a little disappointed with. I really wish you could snap pictures faster. it's still MUCH faster than an average cell phone, so I was still okay. Just not as fast as DSLR's.I was also a little disappointed by the app designed to import pictures to your phone wirelessly. I didn't really know it was going to require wifi, so it's difficult to do while you're out an about for the purpose of social media. Just have to stop at a coffee shop or something. This wasn't the whole reason I bought the camera, so not a huge issue.All and all, I would still really recommend this camera for someone who wants good quality photos without lugging around a huge bag with camera parts. I didn't expect to spend this much, but a quality camera, even one designed to be smaller, lighter and more maneuverable, is going to cost you.

I selected this camera because I need something that was compact, easy and produced high quality images for my business. This camera has done just that. Images are great, stabilization works smoothly. The built-in filters are also a fun bonus. Highly recommend if you're looking to improve your images beyond an iPhone yet don't have the time to learn all the ins and outs of photography and more advanced cameras.

4,4,JTO,5.0,LOVE THIS OLYMPUS E-M10 MARK IV CAMERA!,"
We were going on a Holland America Alaska Land/Cruise and I needed a good but not too expensive camera other than just using my cell phone.  I am not even a novice camera person and I don't have any experience with this type of camera.  However, after many hours of research I decided to pull the trigger and purchased this Olympus camera.  I did as much research as I could on how to use the camera before the trip, but I still could not use most of the camera functions.  However, the pictures and videos I took came out better than I could have imagined and I am happy I made this investment - seems to be idiot-proof!  Now I really need to learn the camera functions!

8,8,Jermaine,2.0,Wanted this to be great.,"
So I would say it is a camera, and it works as a camera if it actually works. My issues are with the like 20-30 minute limit before it stops recording, and I lost some footage thinking it was recording when it had stopped with no notification.My biggest problem currently is that the camera simply stopped working, I charge it and it doesn’t indicate that it’s charging, and it no longer turns on. There was no drop or anything, I hadn’t used it over winter months, and when I tried to use it again when it got warmer, it has never turned on again.I guess you get what you pay for, and even though $800 is pricey in my opinion, I guess I need to spend a few stacks if I want to have the product I actually want.

9,9,Mr. Helpful,3.0,I buffed up point and shoot camera,"
Honestly, for the price I was expecting something more DSLR-y. But what I got was a point-and-shoot that was buffed up to make it look like more than it is. Honestly when I picked it up out of the box I thought someone had scammed me. It feels like a kid's toy, a big hollow plastic camera. If not for the screen on the back, I think anyone could mistake it for that. It feels cheap and hollow inside.  But okay never mind the feel, it's all about the pictures right. And the pictures are on the same level of a point and shoot too. I was prepared to give it a chance, despite my initial disappointment, until I saw the grainy low light pictures and the extremely poor dynamic range on the video. I was very impressed with the autofocus though for pictures, it was very speedy. Less impressed with the videos where it couldn't keep focus when I zoomed in.There are so many easy to access settings that provide those point and shoot features you'd expect, but it also allows you the more precise controls you'd expect from a better camera. The screen on the back is nice too. it's easy to hold when taking selfies, as long as you want to hold it with your left hand. For $200 less it would be a wonderful choice for a high quality point and shoot. And you might find it on sale for that price, And if you do I can recommend it. Maybe this camera is trying to fill that middle range between the two types of cameras.

10,10,Anonymous,3.0,Included lens doesn't fit well and doesn't reliably connect to the camera,"
Not sure if it's just my lens/camera, but the included pancake zoom lens doesn't twist in smoothly and most of the time won't connect to the camera properly without a bunch of fiddling and tweaking and to get the pins just right and power cycling just so. When this happens the camera still kinda works but it breaks autofocus and causes a bunch of lag on the camera as it presumably tries to talk to the lens and fails (even lags on trying to power off). Manual zoom still kinda works in these situations.The camera works just fine with other lenses which twist in much more smoothly and don't have these issues, disappointed that the included lens is giving me so much trouble. Not worth the hassle of returning as I already had to return the camera once due to being delivered an empty box the first time.Otherwise seems to be a really solid camera with a ton of capability, but I did find the camera menus confusing with some settings (image quality) NOT being present in the main settings menu and instead only displayed in a completely different picture menu accessed through photo mode.

11,11,Leo ,4.0,Great base but requires some improvements.,"
Camera is great at almost everything it dose, what it lacks is connective ability that previous models have, you can't currently use it as a webcam or use a laptop or tv as a giant view finder and control device.  The only connectivity you have is using your cellphone through an Olympus app with limited functionality. I wanted something more modern to compliment today's age of seamless cross platform usage & the camera  is just lacking in that aspect, you have wifi & bluetooth  connectivity but its limited. It's difficult to take full advantage of the 180 flip down screen without a sufficient tripod that won't block the screen, it requires some serious creativity. If I could return the camera and buy the OMD E5 Mark iii I would go for it because this camera is limited to just snapping photos and video

12,12,NK,3.0,Short lived,"
After 6 months of gentle use, the lens stopped automatically retracting consistently when I turned the camera off. Today I got an error message saying: ""Please check the status of a lens"".After troubleshooting, I found out that this is a common problem that usually ends with having to replace the lens. Pretty disappointed. My 40+ year-old Cannon hasn't had a single issue.

13,13,William H. Billings,4.0,Newest E-M10 is a step sideways,"
I returned this camera as it did not meet my expectations of it being an improvement over the Mark III, and Mark II.Pros: Image stabilization is superb, size and weight are user friendly, tilting screen is useful for shooting from high, and low perspectives, EVF is bright and shows changes to exposure as they are made, controls are fairly intuitive and customizable, touch-enabled controls are displayed when the screen is in the 'selfie' position. Cons: tripod/selfie stick interfere with screen being moved to 'selfie' position, battery life, USB charging cable included but no external/AC charger provided so extra batteries have to be charged in-camera, camera cannot be used while battery is charging, image quality not noticeably improved with processor and sensor upgrades.  I've used the M10 Mark II and Mark III, and now the Mark IV.  My best images have come from the Mark II.

15,15,Brianna,4.0,Very Cool compact camera! MFT camera sensors are alive and well!,"
Hello! I’m mostly a hobbyist photographer  that loves a good trusty small/compact camera to have on his side for when inspiration kicks in. So far I’m having a whole bunch of fun using this little gem. To compare it to The Sony a6600, which I’ve owned for several months now, I enjoy using the Olympus a lot more. The Sony has a much better autofocus system, but the menu system is terrible and frustrating to use and kind of defeats the purpose of “photo-therapy”. When I wrap my hands around the Olympus ,it is more intuitive , I feel more in Control, and afterwards I have shots that are passionate and that I’m proud of.  The Olympus auto focus may not be on par with the Sony, but for my taste and skill it works. I’m thinking of selling my Sony Aps-c stuff. Idk. I hope this review helps NOW GO OUT AND SHOOT!!!

2 months into owning this camera with VERY light use and around 300 shutter count. One of the dials stopped working. It will continue to cycle one step up and then one step down. Olympus warranty is a joke, I've had to send the camera in at my expense with fragile packing and insurance which comes out to around 50 USD. I have yet to hear back about it so we will see how it goes.Doesn't matter if the camera is good, if it only lasts a couple months before needing to be sent in for repairs at a cost that the customer has to shoulder.
