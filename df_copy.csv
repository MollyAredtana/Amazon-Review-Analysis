I bought this camera for my out of town trip not knowing it didn't have a battery charger. What little charge was on the battery, dissipated in less than half an hour so I packed it up for a return. I should not have to pay a separate fee for a battery charger. Also, the manual was not in English. The user is instructed to go online to view it there or download for printing. Again, why sell a product in the US without an English manual.

I've read up on this camera being a great starter camera. And they're right! It's very simple to use. Even if you don't know the ins and outs of settings. They do have simple/set modes. But should you be able to drive into more of the finer settings, manual mode has got your back!

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)Pros:Affordable Pricing: The Camera comes at a budget-friendly price point, making it accessible to a wide range of consumers.Decent Image Quality: While not exceptional, the camera delivers reasonably good image quality in well-lit conditions, suitable for everyday photography.Compact and Lightweight: The camera's portability makes it easy to carry around, making it a suitable choice for travelers and casual photographers.User-Friendly Interface: The camera's intuitive user interface and straightforward controls make it beginner-friendly.Cons:Mediocre Low-Light Performance: In low-light conditions, the Camera struggles to capture clear and sharp images, resulting in noise and reduced detail.Limited Features: This camera lacks advanced features and settings that enthusiasts and professionals may seek, limiting its versatility.Slow Autofocus: The autofocus system can be sluggish, especially when tracking moving subjects, making it less suitable for capturing fast-paced action.Limited Video Capabilities: Video quality is subpar, with limited resolution options and no advanced video features.Build Quality: The camera's construction feels somewhat cheap, and it may not withstand rough handling or adverse weather conditions.Overall, the Camera is an entry-level camera that delivers average performance for its price. It's a decent option for those who prioritize affordability and simplicity but may not satisfy users looking for more advanced photography features or superior image quality, especially in challenging lighting situations.

This camera provides the flexibility to photograph a wide variety of subjects.  The two lenses allow for close up snapshots, scenic shots and the telephoto lens is great as well.  If you’re a beginner with digital photography, it may take some time to get comfortable with the setting options.  The beauty of digital is you can take photos with different settings/lenses and immediately see the results.  The camera bag that comes with the package is functional, but the divider is fixed and doesn’t accommodate the camera with the zoom lens attached as well as it could.  All in all, a solid camera and lens combo that will work for most casual photography needs.

I first purchased this camera for my trip with my boyfriend back in June. I wanted to make sure I captured quality memories, so I bought this camera. She did not disappoint! Battery life lasts very long, I usually just charged it at the end of every day. These are all raw photos from the camera, unedited and so pretty. If this is your starter camera like it was for me, it definitely takes some time getting used to the controls, but it’s easier to use over time! Speed of capture can be fast or slow depending if you want it focused and non-blurry or in the moment. I definitely want to bring her on all of my future trips. :-)

I cannot use this and will return it. This camera does NOT include what you would think would be the standard 3.5mm jack for external audio that most people want to use for their videos, especially if you're doing any filming outdoors.It's extremely frustrating that this feature is not included. I think it needs to be made very obvious up front that this feature is not available or even compatible for this camera. You cannot even buy an adapter to make it work.If you are wanting to use external audio at all, then this is not the camera for you. Virtually all of the other similar Canons (and DSLR cameras from other manufacturers) include this standard. It's like air conditioning in a new car. Why would you expect any model NOT to have this feature.(Can you tell I'm frustrated?)

I just bought one of these. Big mistake. The hot shoe is lacking a main center contact making it only able to use canon flash units. You cannot even use a flash in manual mode because of this. It also means that any kind of wireless flash triggers are rendered useless. Couple that with no interior contact pins for full interface with a battery grip and this thing is a waste of money.

Not hard to use but it is a little heavy for someone who might have troubles with strength in their arms or hands.

The camera bag is okay but lacks in any storage for accessories and does not really make me feel as though it would protect the camera from the top so I bought a separate bag as well. It comes with a battery and charger. Changing the lens was very simple and quick.

This camera takes beautiful photos and is easy to use for a beginner. Just know that the basic lens that comes with it isn’t going to give you much zoom. Like, your iPhone will zoom closer to distant subjects. Took this camera on a safari in Africa and some of the people in my group got better shots with their phones of animals that were far away. My photo quality was better for things that were nearby though. And it’s no contest in low light. Just know that you’re going to want different lenses for different settings and they are not cheap. Worth it if you’re using a camera regularly though.

Plus these photos I took are edited by me nothing to crazy. The only down fall about this particular camera model is that the hot shoe where you can mount a external flash on top of the camera don’t give you that access.

Love this camera - I have been able to take some amazing photos using this and I have little to no experience with DSLR. I have spent a few ours learning about some settings which I highly recommend - aperture and f stop plus ISO so I have been using this camera on manual settings. I recommend keeping the camera settings on Raw but just keep in mind when you do that using the app to transfer photos to your phone will take an extremely long time.The battery is extremely long lasting. I have been able to use the camera for several uses before needing to charge it. I bought the 50mm lens with this and wow. The lens that comes with it is great, but don't neglect all of the other lenses you can buy. This is a much easier camera to use than other DSLRs as my photographer that we use told me. If you are just getting into using one of these, you're in the right place with this model.Some examples of photos I took as reference.

I've done semi-professional photography for over 10 years now. This is a solid camera for taking product shots with a controlled light source, or a step up from your mobile camera. i was looking for decent camera to take with me to shoot events and family gatherings and my old NIKON was over 10 years old.Pros:Weight: Super Light camera. Doesn't feel like a terrible weight to carry around on your neck.This is important if you carry around on vacation or to family events.Value: The two lens deal offered on black Friday was well worth it - TheEF 75-300mm Lens sells for at least $200 by itself.Easy to Use: The EOS Rebel is a solid camera with lots of abilities and the menus are really easy to use.Cons:WIFI: The Wifi settings are clunky. I don't need to attach to a mobile phone -- a computer would be a better choice IMHO.Cheap Button: Canon has never upgraded the stupid small plastic button to extract the SD cards and battery. Years ago I had to use a tweezer after breaking this off for another Rebel.Overall: I've got a speedlight on order -- I think if you want to get decent shots indoors without using a controlled studio lighting, you'll need additional flash power. Outside, the clarity of the photos using Auto Focus on a wriggly dog is fantastic.

Now, just for some context, I've never even held a ""fancy camera"" (what I'm calling anything above the little handheld digital cameras) It was a little hard for me to figure out the setting and how to use it, but I watched some YouTube videos and got a slight grasp of everything. For some reason the camera will tend to not focus and actually take the picture. It ends up with me awkwardly yelling at my family to hold their pose until the camera will finally decide to click, but I'm going to blame the focusing issue on me lacking knowledge on how to actually use a camera. Another issue I have with the camera is the photo transfer feature (the thing that hooked me into getting this camera was the fact that it could easily transfer photos from your camera to your phone): it's a little annoying to have to go into the settings to even begin a transfer and make sure both the camera and your phone are connected under the same wifi and once you're there the camera is left on a blank screen which makes me scared I'm gonna mess something up. Last minor complaint, I promise. The picture I added with that black kitten, it was actually really hard for the camera to decide to take that picture for some reason, like the lighting wasn't good enough so I had to put my camera light over her just for camera to see there was a subject to aim at and for the flash to go off. Now overall I'm happy with the camera. I love the photos I took with it and I think I just need some more practice with it. It makes me feel like I'm a little professional photographer even though I have no plans of making them look like legit photos one would take.Update 12/2/22I'd recommend getting a backup battery. It does have a decent battery but there are times when I'm in the middle of using it and it needs a charge. Getting the battery to fill takes maybe a couple hours. Side note, *facepalm* there's literally a low lighting mode on the camera. It'll do a short flash to brighten up the subject/area and then it'll take the picture. Getting the camera to focus is still a slight issue for me but it's not as bad as it was when I was first settling in with it.

You get what you pay for -- if you want a great camera make the investment in this one (and don't forget the batteries, the charger and a good SD card).

It can be a bit daunting for a beginner, but the auto focus feature really helps with that. I love the lenses this camera comes with along with the bag to put it all in.

I got this so that I could take pictures of my art and upload it online. The quality of pictures is excellent. I followed the advice of a Pinterest account that recommended this camera for beginners to Professionals due to the ease of use, ability to improve the camera lens, and overall adaptability.  I would agree with all of that and also state that I love the ease of uploading my art online. When using my camera phone, my art just didn’t look the same as in person, but when using this camera it absolutely up’d my game.  I highly recommend this camera.

I gave it a lot of time and even had others make sure everything is set up, before I gave up on it!Eventually it was not worth it and even more disappointing was my iPhone could zoom in way more than this camera.

For my entire life I’ve loved photography but have never owned anything more than your average point-n-shoot cameras in the $100-200 range (my last one was a low-end Panasonic Lumix). Or for the past decade I’ve only used the camera on my iPhone. I was lucky to receive a few Amazon gift cards on my recent birthday so I finally bit the bullet and bought this one. And may I just say...wow. I couldn’t be more pleased.The main thing I’ve always wanted was a camera that could shoot with good depth of field. You know, where the subject being photographed is in sharp focus but the background is blurry, giving the object a more realistic, 3-D look. This camera does that spectacularly, even in fully-automatic, auto-focus mode.I’ve also always wanted a camera that can take great low-light / night shots. My iPhone camera was actually not bad for day-to-day photos but it took HORRIBLE night shots. The moon, for example, was always nothing more than a blurry blob no matter how still I  stayed. Not so with this camera! The dark shots I’ve taken thus far have all been nice and crisp/clear rather than grainy.  Overall I’m very, very happy with my purchase and I haven’t even used the extra telephoto lens that came with it yet! There is still so much I have yet to learn about its many features so I know it’s only going to get better and better once I learn what all its many options can do.

177,David Chamberlain,3.0,Overall a good entry level camera with one glaring omission,"
I bought this camera to upgrade and replace my elder EOS Rebel XTi. The XTi was and still is an excellent camera but it had suffered significant pin damage in the CF card slot and I decided to upgrade instead of having it fixed.The T7 is an excellent entry level camera. While it has some lesser features vs the T7i it is still a very capable camera both in automatic mode and in Program Auto or Manual.The feature I was most disappointed in is the ""Built in Wi-Fi."" Yes, the camera has built in Wi-Fi. You can connect via infrastructure mode (through your home router) or Wi-Fi direct to a smart phone with the Canon smart phone app, to other Canon cameras, certain printers and to a Canon web service.What you cannot do is what you would think would be obvious. You cannot connect the camera via Wi-Fi to the Wi-Fi enabled Canon EOS Utility on a desktop or laptop, in order to download pictures to your computer wirelessly. I was a bit surprised, given that I had a Wi-Fi enabled camera and a Wi-Fi enabled Canon utility that the two would not work together, but apparently Canon chose not to include that feature in the camera's firmware. All the hardware is there to do it, it is simply a software feature not included.So, I knocked a star off of what would have been a 5 star review for the missing feature, and another star off for not making it clear that their Wi-Fi support didn't support one of the most obvious features. I would think anyone who is familiar with Canon's offerings would expect the Wi-Fi enabled camera to connect to the Wi-Fi enabled utility.

I learned photography on 50k Hasselblad cameras. 30 to 50MP back in 2008 that cost as much as a car but let me tell you this little camera can take some good shots. Anyone that says it's hard to use is not to bright lol. There are like a half dozen automatic modes on a knob. I was shocked how well they work. Manual can do 30 seconds of exposure for astrophotography. My only complaint is most automatic modes seem to flip out the flash in low light. Not sure it that can be turned off. I love the raw+ jpeg setting. Let you take two photos at the same time basically. Don't get me wrong the jpeg files look 90% of the raw and 1/3 the size. Awesome camera so far.

When I bought this camera, I was made to believe it was a new camera and it was shipped and delivered overnight. But when I opened the box, I instantly knew that it was a used camera that was deceptively sold as new. No manual, and the camera looked used. I have returned it and am still waiting for my refund. Since I need a camera to shoot some videos, I reordered the same type of camera but as a package with other items. The moment I opened the box I knew the second ordered camera was new. It looked new and clean, manual and other items were new and included.  I didn't make mistake in returning the first ordered camera. Waiting for my refund.

Nice build quality, the pictures come out really good with just the kit lense, definitely recommend for any beginner who has never tried photography! Videos suck, but with some editing and good lighting, you can get a video that is good enough for small businesses. I bought a used T7 and the one thing I would change is the eye lense is very blurry, I have to take most of my pictures on the digital display because with the eye lense, you can’t tell if the person or item is in focus. 4/5 camera, if you have the money definitely buy a new camera or go for the cannon M50 or the M50 mark II.

I have been using my beloved Canon T3 in the past 15 years. Lately, the connection between the camera and the lense has been acting up.

They wanted me to send it to them again. HA! But, I had a ton of lenses for a Canon I cannot afford to replace, so I am stuck with one.This second one has what appears to be oil spots on the photos.

the color isnt too bad, but the dpi is 72 (6000x4000) and therefore pretty horrible pictures, and unable to make decent prints. I do urban wildlife photography and this camera seems a lot worse than my iphoneSE. Forget taking pictures of wildlife or animals with this camera, you'd have to be right up in their faces. the catapillar thing took several minutes to focus enough to take. Also it wouldnt let me change iso and the screen never showed me what i was taking a picture of, you have to use viewfinder. this camera feels mid 90s in quality and overly complicated to use for being an incredibly low quality camera, Im going to have to go with a nikon again. very dissapointed.

Be sure to buy the ""nifty fifty"" lens too, it's great. If you think you're going to become a videographer with this think again.

The T7 is an excellent value for the money.  I got a 128GB microSDXC uhs-1 card at Microcenter (no buffering so far). Very easy to use; advanced capabilities for taking very professional pictures.  This is the third Canon I have owned (AE-1, PowerShot, now the T7) and I am very happy the T7.  The kit lenses, 18-55mm & 75-300mm, are great for general photography (I have done some real estate photography and the 18mm setting is very good for showing a whole room).  I may invest in a Canon fixed 50mm lens for portraits.  I will also get a second battery.  This is such a popular camera, there are literally hundreds of YouTube videos on how the learn the basics and how to employ the T7's advanced settings (get off the Auto settings as soon as you can)

Focus. Just getting the thing to focus, no matter what setting. I don't need all the bells and whistles, and this really seemed to just stick to what you need. With the name brand, several models of history behind it, you would think they got it right. Maybe mine is a dud. And phone camera will take much clearer photos in a much quicker matte of time. This sees to be only good for a 8 foot fixed distance of still photography. Really disappointed hopefully this is a fluke. Returning.

I really like this camera. I use it to photograph my flowers, landscapes or group photos. Just as a hobby and posting on my personal accounts. I have had it since August 2023. Still trying to learn how all the functions, settings, and lenses work. Low light conditions (dark rooms or outside evening) and inside pictures are little bit harder to capture so adjusting the camera for those situations takes time. I use a tripod for group photos which requires setting up before hand which can be frustrating for people waiting. The self timer setting for photos is 10 seconds a little long for most people but I do like you can set up the amount of photos taken. The weight of the lenses does make me decide which one is easier to carry in my hand. The bigger lens is harder to adjust on the tripod because it always wants to tip down and heavier to hold while taking photos. High humidity will fog up the lenses. I try all the different settings for fun. Manual is a little tricky.

I bought this to replace an old camera that was no longer working well. I'm so happy with this camera! The autofocus works great, but you do have to be patient as it takes a few seconds and you have to wait for it to tell you it's ready (beeps). The colors are nice and bright, and I have to do very little editing on the pictures. Even purple comes out well with this camera.My only complaint is it's a complicated multi-step process to send photos to your phone. I also can't get any computer to recognize the camera when plugged in with a data cable to transfer photos that way. I have to take the SD card out and put that in my computer to pull the photos off, then put the card back in the camera. I've tried everything suggested to get it to work with a data cable, but no computer in our house will see the camera, so we're stuck with the inconvenience of having to pull the card.Overall, however, it's an excellent camera and very easy to use.

114,Shutterbug,4.0,Good Price for the kit. Auto Focus is a little finicky,"
I am a long time Pentax user, but when my K50 started acting up, I started looking for something else. This seemed like such a good deal with the 2 lenses, and I've had some experience with Canon in the past. I've been using the T7 for about 3 months now and I am still getting used to it. I find I am using more of the manual settings and getting better results. The auto focus is a little finicky sometimes. I shoot a lot of nature photography and when trying to focus on a bird in the trees it has trouble focusing on the bird and not the branches around it. Overall, I am happy with the results, but I still plan on getting my Pentax fixed.Pros: fairly easy to use, lightweight, great value for the money, good picture quality.Cons:  autofocus can be a little finicky.

178,TWA,3.0,No Continuous Video Shooting,"
This camera takes great pictures and videos, but what everyone needs to be aware of is that, in video mode, it does NOT record longer than 10 - 12 minutes, at which time recording automatically STOPS with no explanation. The only explanation I could find on the Internet was that, even with the highest quality 64Gb SD card, it records only 11 minute files and stops automatically; it does NOT initiate successive 11 minute files automatically. It just stops, and you have to hit the record button to continue recording EACH TIME. There is apparently no fix, firmware update or work around. So don't expect that you can just set it up on a tripod at your child's birthday party, hit RECORD, and forget it. You're going to have to check it every 10-12 minutes and hit RECORD again, and again, and again. Other than that, it's a fine camera.

This is a solid camera for the price. I'm just getting into cameras and I wanted something that's better than my phone (iPhone 13 mini) for a reasonable price. This hit the mark. I will say, for close-up shots with good light, my phone is better. That's the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars.  However, this camera blows my phone away if there is any kind of distance between me and the target. I do mostly landscape shots, and this camera has been solid. I highly recommend getting the bundle with the longer lens.

It’s by no means a bad camera, but you can get way more bang for your buck for the $600 asking price. I ended up getting a refurbished $600 Canon EOS RP, which is both full-frame, mirrorless, and 26.2 megapixels. The obvious downside of the refurbished one is that it is the body/charger/battery only and no lenses, but honestly the kit lenses that come with the Rebel T7 aren’t really the best to begin with, so i’d just recommend getting the EOS RP and saving ur money for better glass

DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!  BUY A T6 WHILE YOU STILL CAN!  Canon purposely built the new T7 without the center sensor in the hot shoe up top so it WILL NOT WORK WITH ANY AFTERMARKET ACCESSORIES!  Without that center pin, you can only use expensive Canon accessories with this camera.The T6 has the exact same Digic 4+ processor as this camera and the exact same features across the board except for an 18 megapixel sensor instead of the 24 megapixel sensor in the T7.  Will you ever notice that difference?  Having shot professionally and as a hobbyist for more than 35 years, no, not unless you're making prints intended for billboards.You might not think it's a big deal, but trust me, you will want to add a speedlight to this camera some day, and then you'll be confined to having to buy a $300 Canon flash instead of any $40 aftermarket flash which works just as well.  The same holds true for flash triggers, strobe remotes, everything.  Canon is really screwing people with this camera, and I've been a faithful Canon user all my life and always will be, but, DO NOT buy this one, you will regret it.  Buy a T6 instead.

The good- usually priced around $500 always seems that between cannon, Walmart, Amazon, or Best Buy you can usually find a sale I bought mine for 399.00- automatic modes are really good and there’s no fluff in using them but the manual modes are easy to learn just watch a YouTube tutorial and maybe keep a cheat sheet in your pocket or bag til you remember what does what and for which circumstance.- light weight- quality is unmatched in the price rangeCons - the shoulder strap is small and kind of sucks I prefer an aftermarket one or a lanyard style  one similar to the ones that came on the Wii remote this way it’s attached but still have tons of mobilityHint:If your not not a big fan of huge camera bags and end up holding your camera a lot just get a small cross body or shoulder bag works great for an extra lens or two and a few batteries maybe a cleaning cloth and whatever else you need

I want a camera that is flexible, but not complicated.I'm not interested in a point & shoot, but there should be a mode that is basically that.I have a very difficult time getting the focus right. It's VERY rarely ""just right"", I've tried auto focus & manual. Same with the color. My cell phone should not take better pictures that a DLSR camera that I spent hundreds of dollars on.For years I had only Nikon equipment. I wish I had spent the extra & stayed with what I knew.

I recently got into photography and have been using this for the past couple months. I love the fact that it’s easy to use, comes with a decent lens (unless you want a lens hood), and there’s a lot of content on YouTube teaching you how to use it out of the box. I wish the video was able to record 1080p60 instead of only up to 1080p30/720p60. It’s hard to grasp everything out of the box for a beginner, but after a YouTube video or two, it’s easy and fun to use. Excellent camera.

If you're starting out, this is a phenomenal starter camera. It isn't the most high-quality big photographic camera ever, but it is very good quality for the money. I used it for sports photography so accompanied with a good autofocus lens, this camera can be great for sports photography. It captures the movement and details perfectly. I attached some samples.

221,Magdalena,1.0,Really Bad Camera,"
I had to return this camera. It is way to complicated. Some reviews said it was a beginners camera and it is not. I have been using cameras for 60 years. Started with a Pentax manual that took film. Was so glad when digital camera came as I had put so much money into film and develement. I had a Cannon Powershot for 10 years that I loved. But it died. I decided to upgrade to the Rebel as I had used a friends and liked it. The one I bought did not even seem like the same camera. Way to much complicated instructions to do the most simple things. Charged battery, put in a new memory card. Took 25 photos and camera told me card was full. Normally I can get 300 to 400 photos on a card depending on how much vidio I take which usually isn't that much. I prefer taking stills.  I have never had a problem with a memory card but you never know. I put in another card that was new and a different brand. Same thing. 25 photos and camera said it was full. This was not good. I put those photos on computer and was disappointed with the quality. I could have done just as well with my cell phone.The zoom on the camera seemed to have a problem, too. It would take 10 to 15 seconds or more to auto focas on what I wanted to take a picture of. With still life or flowers or sceanery I would get the sakes by the time it would focas. I could find no way to turn off the auto focas. Even putting it on manual and sports did not do any good. That ment if I was trying to get a shot of something moving it was long gone by the time the auto focas did it's thing. Tried to call Cannon Support. No answer. Emailed them. No answer. I gave up on this camera and sent it back. Sure not worth what I payed for it.

I love photography, videography, and video editing so I was looking for a camera that had good video quality in addition to pictures. This camera takes a little bit of time to get used to and learn, but it was worth the investment once I played with it and experimented with the different features and functions. It also makes a great webcam as I use it for video chatting with my family and friends over Discord. My recommendation to anyone looking to use this as a webcam is purchase a dummy battery as the battery only lasts 2 hours.It does require the use of a lens and, if you want to transfer pictures directly to your PC without removing the memory card, you'll need the EOS Utility program that you can download from the Canon website. There is a WiFi feature that lets you upload your pictures to your phone or directly to the internet as well.

The Canon EOS Rebel T7 was described as a good camera for beginners - not true.  Only in Auto Focus is it a point and shoot camera and then it takes the auto focus 15 seconds to focus and shoot - by then my subject had moved on.  This camera definitely requires an extensive education in photography or much experience with this type of camera in order to operate in its many modes and settings.  Probably a great camera for someone with the education or experience - but definitely not for beginners.  Need to change this language in item description.  Returned item satisfactorily.

61,Thy Huynh,5.0,Useful for beginner photography students,"
I bought this camera for my Digital Photography class to replace my smaller Powershot one that didn't have the RAW option. As I’m totally new to DSLR cameras, this one was so helpful for my course and it offered lots of functions that would not be too overwhelming for beginners. This camera can shoot with a great range of depth of field (f/4.5 to f/29). I like that it meets many requirements for my course like the RAW image quality and Adobe RGB color space. It has many shooting modes for different purposes like Scene Intelligent Auto, Portrait, Night Portrait, Sports, Landscape, Close-up, Food, etc. It took me a few days to remember how things work on my camera, but I got help from other people and the manual. Easy to operate, both the strap and the lens. Using the RAW option helped me achieve high-quality images (and very large files as well). Great battery life, using the standard camera got me less worried than my previous Powershot model. The only thing is that I should have bought a zoom lens since the lens coming up with this one is great but quite limited for my shooting goals. Other than that, this model is worth the money and helpful for beginners (would be even better if you took a Photography course or have professional photographers to help you).

I bought this to record music videos as well as take still photos.I found out that the .MOV files that Canon produces are unusable on Apple and will not transfer (""unsupported file format"").  The Canon software will not transfer the files over Wi-FI.There are many technical discussions about this on various forums.  Essentially, you can jump through a bunch of hoops and use third-party software to create an Apple-compatible MP4 file but it's not easy or convenient.  I would never have purchased this product if I knew this in advance.  This is the last time i EVER purchase a Canon product.
